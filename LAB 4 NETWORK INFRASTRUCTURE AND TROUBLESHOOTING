Task troubleshooting:
  LAB-RA08-C-R03:
  tftp source-interface GigabitEthernet0/0.10: is used on Cisco network devices to specify the source interface to be used for TFTP file transfer (Trivial File Transfer Protocol).
  encapsulation dot1Q 10: is used to configure a subinterface on a Cisco network device with IEEE 802.1Q VLAN encapsulation and associate it with VLAN 10. It is typically used on a router or switch to enable communication between VLANs through a trunk link.
  standby 10 ip 172.16.8.1: is used to configure a virtual IP address for a Cisco HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) group 10. 
  router-id 10.199.66.108: is used in the configuration of the OSPF routing protocol on Cisco network devices to manually specify the OSPF router ID.
  network 10.199.66.96 0.0.0.31 area 0: is used in the configuration of the OSPF routing protocol on Cisco network devices to advertise the networks to be included in the OSPF routing process.
  
Task verification:
  TFTP source-interface: Verify that the file transfer is successful between the network devices.
  Interface configuration: Verify the configuration by checking the interface status, VLAN association, and connectivity.
  Encapsulation dot1Q: Verify that VLAN communication is established between different VLANs using the trunk link connected to the router or switch.
  Standby virtual IP: Verify that the routers are functioning as a single virtual router by checking the HSRP status and connectivity to hosts on the LAN.
  OSPF and Router ID configuration: Check OSPF routing table and routing updates to ensure the exchange of routing information.
