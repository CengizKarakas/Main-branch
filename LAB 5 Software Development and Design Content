Integrating Git with GitHub
Create a Repository.  
  Select the “New repository” button or click on the “+” icon in the upper right corner and select “New repository
  Repository name: devasc-study-team
  Description: Working together to pass the DEVASC exam
  Public/Private: Private
Select: Create repository
Create a new directory devasc-study-team
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/git-intro$ mkdir devasc-study-team
Copy the DEVASC file.
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/git-intro/devasc-study-team$ cp ../DEVASC.txt .
Initialize a new Git repository
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/git-intro/devasc-study-team$ git init
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/git-intro/devasc-study-team$ git config --list
  devasc@labvm:~$ git config --global user.name "CengizKarakas"
  devasc@labvm:~$ git config --global user.email cengiz.karakas@student.pxl.be
Point Git repository to GitHub repository.
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/git-intro/devasc-study-team$ git remote add origin https://github.com/CengizKarakas/devasc-study-team.git
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/git-intro/devasc-study-team$ git remote --verbose
Stage and Commit the DEVASC.txt file.  
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/git-intro/devasc-study-team$ git add DEVASC.txt

Send (push) the file from Git to GitHub  
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/git-intro/devasc-study-team$ git push origin master
  Username for 'https://github.com': CengizKarakas
  Password for 'https://CengizKarakas@github.com': XXXXXXXX
Verify file on GitHub.
  Go to your GitHub account and under “Repositories” select username/devasc-study-team.
  You should see that the DEVASC.txt file has been added to this GitHub repository. Click on the file to view the contents.

Task troubleshooting:
  If, after entering your username and password, you get a fatal error stating repository is not found, you most likely submitted an incorrect URL. You will need to reverse your git add command with the git remote rm origin command.
  Your email address on Github must match. You can see your e-mail address in the profile settings on Github. Type "git config --list" in Terminal and check the information.
Task verification:
  You can use the following commands for verification.
  git status
  git log
  git config --list
  cat
  git branch
  git diff b510f8e 9f5c4c5 #You will need to use your commit IDs
  
Part 2: Create a Python Unit Test
Lab netacad: Cisco DEVNET 3.5.7
Task preparation and implementation:
All of the command line options for unittest
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src$ python3 -m unittest -h
Review the test_data.py file.
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src$ more unittest/test_data.py 
  Something is niet correct and we have to find it.
Create the json_search() function that you will be testing.
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/unittest$ python3 recursive_json_search.py 
  Python script is in LAB 5 ScriptsFile.
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/unittest$ python3 test_json_search.py 
   []
  .F.  # Run the test script in its current state to see what results it currently returns. First, you see the empty list. Second, you see the .F. highlighted in the output. A period (.) means a test passed and an F means a test failed.
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/unittest$ python3 -m unittest -v test_json_search
Investigate and correct the first error in the recursive_json_search.py script.
  Move the ret_val=[ ] out of our function in recursive_json_search.py so that the iteration does not overwrite the accumulated list each time.
      def json_search(key,input_object):
        ret_val=[]
  Move the ret_val=[ ] out of our function in recursive_json_search.py so that the iteration does not overwrite the accumulated list each time.
      ret_val=[]
      def json_search(key,input_object):
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/unittest$ python3 recursive_json_search.py  
Run the test again to see if all errors in the script are now fixed.
  Open the test_data.py file and search for issueSummary
  if you search for the value of key2, which is XY&^$#*@!1234%^&, you will only find it at the top where it is defined because it is not in the data JSON object.
Investigate and correct the second error in the recursive_json_search.py script.  
  To resolve this issue, wrap the json_search() function with an outer function. Delete your existing json_search() function and replace with the code in LAB 5 ScriptsFile
  if you search for the value of key2, which is XY&^$#*@!1234%^&, you will only find it at the top where it is defined because it is not in the data JSON object.
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/unittest$ python3 -m unittest

Part 3: Parse Different Data Types with Python
Lab netacad: cisco DEVNET 3.6.6

Task preparation and implementation:
Parse XML in Python
Build a script to parse the XML data.
  Import the ElementTree module of the xml library and the regular expression engine. The ElementTree module will be used to do the parsing. The regular expression engine will be used to search for specific data.
  Use the parse function from ET (ElementTree) to parse the myfile.xml file and assign it to a variable (xml). Then, get the root element with the getroot function and assign it to a variable (root).
  The goal is to extract the contents of the XML root content within the <rpc> tag and then further drill down to find the values of the <edit-config>, <default-operation>, and <test-option> elements. Regular expressions are used to perform these searches and retrieve the desired information.
  Check out the LAB-5 ScriptsFile and the LAB-5 Foto's.
Parse JSON in Python
  The Python yaml library can be used to convert the data to YAML.
  Open the parsejson.py file found in the ~/labs/devnet-src/parsing directory.
  Import the json and yaml libraries.
  Use the Python with statement to open json and set it to the variable name json_file. Then use the json.load method to load the JSON file into a string set to the variable name ourjson.
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/parsing$ python3 parsejson.py 
Parse YAML in Python
  Open the parseyaml.py file found in the ~/labs/devnet-src/parsing directory.
  Import the json and yaml libraries.
  Use the Python with statement to open yaml and set it to the variable name yaml_file. Then use the yaml.safe_load method to load the YAML file into a string set to the variable name ouryaml.
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/parsing$ python3 parseyaml.py 
Output the parsed YAML data in a JSON data format.
  Add a print statement to add two blank lines after the previous output. Then add a statement to print ouryaml as JSON data by using the dumps() method of the json library. Add the indent parameter to prettify the JSON data.
  devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/parsing$ python3 parseyaml.py
