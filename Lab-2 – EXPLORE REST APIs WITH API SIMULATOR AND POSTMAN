Task troubleshooting:

Add books using the POST /books API
If you got a 401 code, check the Response body text. Most likely you received an “error”: “Invalid API key” response. This is because you did not enter all the characters for your API key. Or possibly, you add an unnecessary space.
You can verify the books were added to the Our Books Return to the School Library tab in your browser (http://library.demo.local) and refresh the page. Be careful not to close the School Library API tab. If you do, then you will need to reauthenticate.
