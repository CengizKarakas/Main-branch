Part 1: Python Programming Review
Lab netacad: Cisco DEVNET 1.3.3
Task preparation and implementation:
Review different Boolean operators.
  >	Greater than
  <	Less than
  ==	Equal to
  !=	Not equal to
  >=	Greater than or equal to
  <=	Less than or equal to
You may want to display a float to a specific number of decimal places instead of the full number. To do this, you can use f-strings and the "{:.2f}".format function.
    >>> num = 22/7
    >>> f"The value of num is {num}"
    'The value of num is 3.142857142857143'
    >>> pi = "{:.2f}".format(num)
    >>> f"The value of pi is {pi}."
    'The value of pi is 3.14.'
How to create a list variable:
    >>> hostnames=["R1","R2","R3","S1","S2"]
    >>> type(hostnames)
    <class 'list'>
    >>> len(hostnames)
    5
    >>> hostnames
    ['R1', 'R2', 'R3', 'S1', 'S2']
Using index for list
    >>> hostnames[0]
    'R1'
    >>> hostnames[-1]
    'S2'
    >>> hostnames[0]="RTR1"
    >>> hostnames
    ['RTR1', 'R2', 'R3', 'S1', 'S2']
    >>> del hostnames[3]
    >>> hostnames
    ['RTR1', 'R2', 'R3', 'S2']
Create and manipulate a dictionary. Dictionaries are unordered lists of objects. Each object contains a key/value pair. Create a dictionary using the braces { }.
    >>> ipAddress={"R1":"10.1.1.1","R2":"10.2.2.1","R3":"10.3.3.1"}
    >>> type(ipAddress)
    <class 'dict'>
    >>> ipAddress["S1"]="10.1.1.10"
    >>> ipAddress
    {'R1': '10.1.1.1', 'R2': '10.2.2.1', 'R3': '10.3.3.1', 'S1': '10.1.1.10'}
    >>> ipAddress["R3"]=["10.3.3.1","10.3.3.2","10.3.3.3"]
    >>> ipAddress
    {'S1': '10.1.1.10', 'R2': '10.2.2.1', 'R1': '10.1.1.1', 'R3': ['10.3.3.1', '10.3.3.2', '10.3.3.3']}
Create a variable to store user input and then display the value.
  Assign the input() function to a variable that asks the user for input and then print the value of the user’s input.
  Check out personal-info.py in LAB-3 ScriptsFile
Create an if/else function.  
  Check out if-vlan.py in LAB-3 ScriptsFile
Create an if/elif/else function.
  Check out if-acl.py in LAB-3 ScriptsFile
Create a for loop.
The Python for function is used to loop or iterate through the elements in a list or perform an operation on a series of values.
  >>> devices=["R1","R2","R3"]
  >>> for item in devices:
  ... print(item)
  ... 
  R1
  R2
  R3
An if statement can be embedded in a for loop to achieve this.
  >>> for item in devices:
  ... if "R" in item:
  ... print(item)
  ... 
  R1
  R2
  R3
You can also use a combination of the for loop and if statement to create a new list. Enter the following example to see how to use the append() method to create a new list called switches.
  >>> switches=[]
  >>> for item in devices:
  ... if "S" in item:
  ... switches.append(item)
  ... 
  >>> switches
  ['S1', 'S2']
While Loop en Use a while loop to check for a user quit command.
  Check out while-loop.py, while-loop2.py and while-loop3.py in LAB-3 ScriptsFile
Create a program that reads an external file and Remove the blank lines from the output and Copy the content of a file into a list variable.
  The open() function can be used to access a file using the following syntax:  open(name, [mode])
  Check out the devices.txt, file-access.py, file-access2.py and file-access3.py in LAB-3 ScriptsFile
Create a script to allow the user to add devices
  Check out file-access-input.py in LAB-3 ScriptsFile
  
Task troubleshooting:
In Python, use four spaces to indent. If you save your file in VS Code, this four space indention will be automatic. When beginning the else statement, make sure to backspace to the left margin.
Be sure you enter four (4) spaces to indent the print() function and press the Enter key twice to exit the for loop.
Be sure you enter four (4) spaces to indent the if function and the eight (8) spaces to indent the print() function. Press the Enter key twice to exit and execute the for loop.

Part 2: Explore Python Development Tools

Lab netacad: Cisco DEVNET 3.1.12
Task preparation and implementation:
Enter the following command to use the venv tool to create a Python 3 virtual environment with the name devfun.
    devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ python3 -m venv devfun
Activate and test the Python 3 virtual environment.
    devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ source devfun/bin/activate
    (devfun) devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ pip3 freeze
    (devfun) devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ pip3 install requests
    (devfun) devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ deactivate
Check the current packages installed in the system environment.
    devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ python3 -m pip freeze
Sharing Your Virtual Environment 
    You can use all the dependencies listed so that other people who want to work on the same project as you can get the same environment as yours.
    devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ source devfun/bin/activate
Send the output of the pip3 freeze command to a text file called requirements.txt.
    (devfun) devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
Create and activate a new Python virtual environment called devnew.
    devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ python3 -m venv devnew
    devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ source devnew/bin/activate
Use the pip3 install -r requirements.txt command to install the same packages that are installed in the devfun virtual environment.
    (devnew) devasc@labvm:~/labs/devnet-src/python$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Part 3: Explore Python Classes
Lab netacad: cisco DEVNET 3.4.6

Task preparation and implementation:
What is a function?
  Recall that a function is an independently defined block of code that is called by name.
What is a method?
  A method, however, cannot be called by itself. It is dependent on the object in which it is defined.
Define and then instantiate a class with the __init__() method.
  A Python class is used to create objects that have properties and methods. All Python classes typically include an explicitly defined __init__() function, although you can create a class without defining one. The __init__() function is always initiated when a class is instantiated.
  Define the __init__() function. By convention, the first parameter is called self. The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class itself and is used to access variables that belong to the entire class.
    def __init__(self, name, country):
        self.name = name
        self.country = country
      loc = Location("Your_Name", "Your_Country")
Task troubleshooting:
  Spaces are important, otherwise the script will throw an error.
