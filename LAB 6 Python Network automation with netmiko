Part 1: Connecting to a single iOS device
Task preparation and implementation:
- Sending single show command
- Sending multiple show commands
- Send multiple configuration commands to a single device
You can find sample python scripts in LAB-6 ScriptsFile.
Remember to modify the script according to your network environment and specific use cases.

Part 2: Connect to multiple IOS devices
Task preparation and implementation:
- Send show commands to multiple devices
- Send configuration commands to multiple devices
- Run show commands and save the output
- Backup the device configurations
- Configure a subset of Interfaces
- Send device configuration using an external file
- Connect using a Python Dictionary
- Execute a script with a Function or classes
- Execute a script with a statements (if, ifelse, else)
You can find sample python scripts in LAB-6 ScriptsFile.
Remember to modify the script according to your network environment and specific use cases.

Part 3: Connect to IOS-XE devices
Task preparation and implementation:
- Send show commands to multiple devices
- Send configuration commands to multiple devices
- Run show commands and save the output
- Backup the device configurations
- Configure a subset of Interfaces
- Send device configuration using an external file
- Connect using a Python Dictionary
- Execute a script with a Function or classes
- Execute a script with a statements (if, ifelse, else)
You can find sample python scripts in LAB-6 ScriptsFile.
Remember to modify the script according to your network environment and specific use cases.

Part 4: Create an challenging excited script as a network
Task preparation and implementation:
- Create an exciting and challenging script that a network engineer in a programmable era
would use every day. 
You can find sample python scripts in LAB-6 ScriptsFile.
Remember to modify the script according to your network environment and specific use cases.
In the script included in LAB-6 ScriptsFile_Part 4, the network engineer can connect to Cisco IOS devices, retrieve device information, send device configuration commands, and perform advanced operations.

Task troubleshooting:
If you don't forget to modify the script according to your network environment and specific use cases, you shouldn't run into any problems.

Connect to IOS-XE devices:
Ensure that the device's IP address, username, and password are correctly specified in the device dictionary.
Verify that the device is reachable from the machine running the script.
Check for any firewall or access control lists that may be blocking the connection.
Confirm that SSH is enabled on the IOS-XE device and the correct SSH port (default: 22) is being used.

Send device configuration using an external file:
Check the file path and ensure that the file containing the configuration commands exists and is accessible.
Verify the format of the configuration commands in the file. Ensure that each command is on a separate line.
Validate that the configuration commands are appropriate for the IOS-XE device and its current configuration mode.
Confirm that the device has the necessary privileges to execute the configuration commands.

Connect using a Python Dictionary:
Ensure that the dictionary contains the required key-value pairs such as 'device_type', 'ip', 'username', and 'password'.
Validate that the specified 'device_type' matches the device type (e.g., 'cisco_xe' for IOS-XE devices).
Check that the IP address, username, and password provided in the dictionary are accurate.
Verify that the necessary Python libraries (e.g., Netmiko, Paramiko) are installed and up-to-date.

Execute a script with a Function or classes:
Ensure that the function or class that performs the connection and operations on the IOS-XE devices is defined correctly.
Verify that the function or class is called with the appropriate arguments (e.g., the device dictionary, configuration commands).
Check for any syntax errors or logical errors in the script.
Validate that the required libraries and dependencies are imported and available.

Execute a script with if, if-else, else statements:
Confirm that the conditions specified in the if, if-else, else statements accurately match the desired logic.
Validate that the commands executed within each branch of the if statements are correct and appropriate for the task.
Ensure that the necessary variables, functions, or classes are defined and accessible within the script.
Check for any indentation errors, as Python relies on proper indentation to define code blocks.
