Part 1: Connecting to a single iOS device
Task preparation and implementation:
- Sending single show command
- Sending multiple show commands
- Send multiple configuration commands to a single device
You can find sample python scripts in LAB-6 ScriptsFile.
Remember to modify the script according to your network environment and specific use cases.

Part 2: Connect to multiple IOS devices
Task preparation and implementation:
- Send show commands to multiple devices
- Send configuration commands to multiple devices
- Run show commands and save the output
- Backup the device configurations
- Configure a subset of Interfaces
- Send device configuration using an external file
- Connect using a Python Dictionary
- Execute a script with a Function or classes
- Execute a script with a statements (if, ifelse, else)
You can find sample python scripts in LAB-6 ScriptsFile.
Remember to modify the script according to your network environment and specific use cases.

Part 3: Connect to IOS-XE devices
Task preparation and implementation:
- Send show commands to multiple devices
- Send configuration commands to multiple devices
- Run show commands and save the output
- Backup the device configurations
- Configure a subset of Interfaces
- Send device configuration using an external file
- Connect using a Python Dictionary
- Execute a script with a Function or classes
- Execute a script with a statements (if, ifelse, else)
You can find sample python scripts in LAB-6 ScriptsFile.
Remember to modify the script according to your network environment and specific use cases.

Part 4: Create an challenging excited script as a network
Task preparation and implementation:
- Create an exciting and challenging script that a network engineer in a programmable era
would use every day. 
You can find sample python scripts in LAB-6 ScriptsFile.
Remember to modify the script according to your network environment and specific use cases.
In the script included in LAB-6 ScriptsFile_Part 4, the network engineer can connect to Cisco IOS devices, retrieve device information, send device configuration commands, and perform advanced operations.

Task troubleshooting:
If you don't forget to modify the script according to your network environment and specific use cases, you shouldn't run into any problems.
